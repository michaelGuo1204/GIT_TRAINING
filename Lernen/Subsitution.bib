  abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {In this review, we survey work that has been carried out in the attempts of biomathematicians to understand the dynamic behaviour of simple bacterial operons starting with the initial work of the 1960's. We concentrate on the simplest of situations, discussing both repressible and inducible systems and then turning to concrete examples related to the biology of the lactose and tryptophan operons. We conclude with a brief discussion of the role of both extrinsic noise and so-called intrinsic noise in the form of translational and/or transcriptional bursting.},

  abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis araC locus, mapped at about 294°on the genetic map, was defined by mutations conferring an Ara- phenotype to strains bearing the metabolic araA, araB, and araD wild-type alleles (located at about 256°on the genetic map) and by mutants showing constitutive expression of the three genes. In previous work, it has been postulated that the gene in which these mutations lie exerts its effect on the ara metabolic operon in trans, and this locus was named araC by analogy to the Escherichia coli regulatory gene. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the araC locus. This region comprises two open reading frames with divergently arranged promoters, the regulatory gene, araC, encoding a 41-kDa polypeptide, and a partially cloned gene, termed araE, which most probably codes for a permease involved in the transport of L-arabinose. The DNA sequence of araC revealed that its putative product is very similar to a number of bacterial negative regulators (the GalR-LacI family). However, a helix-turn-helix motif was identified in the N-terminal region by its identity to the consensus signature sequence of another group of repressors, the GntR family. The lack of similarity between the predicted primary structure of the product encoded by the B. subtilis regulatory gene and the AraC regulator from E. coli and the apparently different modes of action of these two proteins lead us to propose a new name, araR, for this gene. The araR gene is monocistronic, and the promoter region contains -10 and -35 regions (as determined by primer extension analysis) similar to those recognized by RNA polymerase containing the major vegetative cell sigma factor $\sigma$(A). An insertion-deletion mutation in the araR gene leads to constitutive expression of the L-arabinose metabolic operon. We demonstrate that the araR gene codes for a negative regulator of the ara operon and that the expression of araR is repressed by its own product.},

  abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis L-arabinose metabolic genes araA, araB and araD, encoding L-arabinose isomerase, L-ri bulokinase and {\~{}}-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase, respectively, have been cloned previously and the products of araB and araD were shown to be functionally homologous to their Escherichia coli counterparts by complementation experiments. Here we report that araA, araB and araD, whose inactivation leads to an Ara' phenotype, are the first three ORFs of a nine cistron transcriptional unit with a total length of 11 kb. This operon, called ara, is located at about 256" on the B. subtilis genetic map and contains six new genes named araL, araM, araN, araP, araQ and abfA. Expression of the ara operon is directed by a strong {\&}like promoter identified within a 150 bp DNA fragment upstream from the translation start site of araA. Analysis of the sequence of the ara operon showed that the putative products of araN, araP and araQ are homologous to bacterial components of binding-protein-dependent transport systems and abfA most probably encodes an a-L-arabinofuranosidase. The functions of araL and araM are unknown. An in vitro-constructed insertion-deletion mutation in the region downstream from araD allowed us to demonstrate that araf, araM, araN, araP, araQ and abfA are not essential for L-arabinose utilization. Studies with strains bearing transcriptional fusions of the operon to the E. coli lacZ gene revealed that expression from the ara promoter is induced by L-arabinose and repressed by g I ucose.

  abstract  = {A mathematical model for the regulation of induction in the lac operon in Escherichia coli is presented. This model takes into account the dynamics of the permease facilitating the internalization of external lactose; internal lactose; $\beta$-galactosidase, which is involved in the conversion of lactose to allolactose, glucose and galactose; the allolactose interactions with the lac repressor; and mRNA. The final model consists of five nonlinear differential delay equations with delays due to the transcription and translation process. We have paid particular attention to the estimation of the parameters in the model. We have tested our model against two sets of $\beta$-galactosidase activity versus time data, as well as a set of data on $\beta$-galactosidase activity during periodic phosphate feeding. In all three cases we find excellent agreement between the data and the model predictions. Analytical and numerical studies also indicate that for physiologically realistic values of the external lactose and the bacterial growth rate, a regime exists where there may be bistable steady-state behavior, and that this corresponds to a cusp bifurcation in the model dynamics.},
